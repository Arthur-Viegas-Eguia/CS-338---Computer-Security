===== DAYTIME =====
1 - 1  192.168.64.4  129.6.15.29   TCP  [SYN] Seq=0 Win=6420 Len=0 MSS=1460

2 - 53642
3 - The source port tells the TCP protocol that certain HTTP request is supposed to go from this 
specific port in my machine (the source machine), in this case port 53642, to this other port (in this example 13) in 
the other machine. For the same reason  we need a destination port (know which software we are)
talking to), we need a source port.

4 - 4  129.6.15.29  192.168.64.4 DAYTIME DAYTIME Response

5 - The frame which is left is the Daytime protocol. It contains the field "Type." which is Type: Response
It also contains the field "Daytime," which contains the message per se.
The message  starts with a new line and is:
6202 followed by date in the format yy-mm-dd, the time hh:mm:ss followed by 50 0 0 640.9 UTC(NIST) * 
The message ends with a new line. I suppose the new line is necessary for the date to be properly formatted
in the terminal. NIST is the source of the information, UTC is the Standart timezone at the prime 
meridian.

6 - [SYN] is a Synchronization packet. The client sends it when it wants to initiate the communication
with a server. Along with that, it sends the port the client is running at (which is usually random). [SYN] means
roughly something like "Hey, let's talk."
The server might answer with its own [SYN] packet, which means "We want to talk in the other direction too, I want
to reply to you."

7 - [ACK] is an acknowledgement packet. It acknowledges the sequence number it has just received. Informally it means, "Got your message"

8 - [FIN] is a finalize packet. It is used to finalize the communication. At the end one of the parties
must say "I'm done talking." It can be  the client, who does not want to send any more queries or it can be the 
server who says "I've shown it to you."

9 - The daytime server did. The first FIN package was sent by IP address 129.6.15.29, which is the server. 

===== HTTP =====

1 - 2 Connections were initiated. This was a bit weird at first, as it seemed that the computer would only need to request a single connection. 
But there were two SYN packages sent from my computer and their content seemed to have the same content except for port, stream index, sequence number (raw) which indicates they are a different connection. Checksum was different too.
The server also sent two [SYN, ACK] which further confirms my claims.
I attached screenshots of this in this folder. 

2 - It was requested on the package which goes like:
192.168.64.4    45.79.89.123    HTTP    GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
This is the package as it was sent from my machine to the server, and is a GET from HTTP. The name of the page also matches. 

3 - It is on the package which goes like:
192.168.64.4    45.79.89.123    HTTP    GET /jeff_square_head.jpg HTTP/1.1
I know this is the right package as it was sent from my machine to the server (based on the IP addresses), it was a GET, which indicates it was a request and the name of the item requested is the image


===== QUESTIONS =====

Is this even legal? If so why/how?
