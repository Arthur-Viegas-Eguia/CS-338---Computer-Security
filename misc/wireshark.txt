3 - The source port tells the TCP protocol that certain HTTP request is supposed to go from this 
specific port in my machine (in this case port 53642), which is the source machine to this other port (in this example 13) in 
the other machine. For the same reason  we need a destination port (know which software we are)
talking to), we need a source port 
The TCP, or transmission control protocol ensures that all packages arrived at a machine
and that the packages are in order. It arranges for packages to be retransmitted if they do not
show up in time, or show up corrupted. It reorders the packages so they are in the proper order, and
throws out duplicates. To do all of that, TCP requires a bunch of book keeping information. 
One of such information is source port.

5 - The frame which is left is the Daytime protocol. It contains the type, which is Type: Response
The message is starts with a new line and is:
6202 followed by date in the format yy-mm-dd, the time hh:mm:ss followed by 50 0 0 640.9 UTC(NIST) * 
The message ends with a new line. I suppose th new line is necessary for the date to be properly formatted
in the terminal. NIST is the source of the information, UTC is the Standart timezone at the prime 
meridian.

6 - [SYN] is a Synchronization packet. The client sends it when it wants to initiate the communication
with a server. Along with that, it sends the port the client is running at (which is usually random). It means
roughly something like "Hey, let's talk."
The server might answer with its own [SYN] packet, which means "We want to talk in the other direction too, I want
to reply to you."

7 - [ACK] is an acknowledgement packet. It acknowledges the sequence number it has just received. Informally it means, "Got your message"

8 - [FIN] is a finalize packet. It is used to finalize the communication. At the end one of the parties
must say I'm done talking. It can be  the client, who does not want to sent any more queries or it can be the 
server who says I've shown it to you.

9 - The daytime server did. The first FIN package was sent by IP address 129.6.15.29, which is the server.
